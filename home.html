				About Ghostdust
			</span><br>
			 
				Ghostdust is a collection of my audio mixes and the photos that I feel best describe them. The following is a description of how the audio files came about:
When I was in Hunter college studying sculpture, I took a class called video for artists. One of the assignments was to create a video with our own original sound. Now I had
never really thought about sound. At the time I felt that there was no video I could produce that would need anything more than a track from Moby's Play album or Radiohead's 
Kid A album. This assignment was problematic.  It was 2001 and I had never even heard of a 4 track. I remember standing there
astonished as a sales associate at Sam Ash explained how it worked. I could record whatever I wanted he said, rewind the tape, and record on another track, and then play both
recordings at the same time! I was floored. I was sold! So I took one home, along with an rca splitter that would allow me to send music from my precious hi-tec cd
walkman straight through any of the activated tracks. The results were horrifyingly bad. Till this day I am not quite sure if the dark, brooding and disjointed themes of my videos 
were caused by my urban isolation and homesickness or if it was simply to fit the rythmless, interminable and structureless results of layering film scores with electronic music samples. The thing of it is, even back then all those years ago, I never thought the stuff I was

			<p id="ghostinfo">  making was great or good or even music for that matter.
				  At no point  was I ever gripped by the mid creation megalomania of thinking that this stuff was somehow great. It was just absolutely and undeniably fun. It was a creative outlet that was free from any intellectual pressures. I was some untrained idiot after all groping around in the dark. There was always floating feeling I had when I sat around piecing little audio files together. I have to say that I do not get to play with music enough, enough to where my little creations may actually become musical but it has been therapeutic in my careerless meandering. It was always a great escape.
In my early thirties I was juggling two jobs. I was working overnights at a hotel and working as an EMT on the weekends. After I had resigned to the idea  that I would either have a high pressure career in Emergency Medical Services or a pride swallowing servile deskjob in Hospitality Management, it was this exercise that reminded me that I was still creative after all and that maybe just maybe the rest of my life would not have to be
so uncreative. I love music. I hope one day I find the time to learn how to play an instrument. Understand its language and maybe even make music. But for now all I have is a few of these audio files. 
I hope you listen to them. I hope you smile.
